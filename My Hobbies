<h1> My Hobbies</h1>
<hr />
<p>I enjoy learning new things and am always trying to better myself through online courses or videos.<br>
I spend most of my time with my Wife and two kids and we always try to keep them active so we spend alot of time at playgrounds, swimming pools, and at our little camp.<br>
I enjoy Fishing when i can get the time and also enjoy just being out doors.
<br>
Right now my biggest hobbie is learning how to code and trying to push myself to get really good at it.</p>
